# Code Generation

50-75 >= lines we need to modularize and separate concerns better.

- Prefer modular, single-responsibility functions for maintainability.
- Separate concerns: avoid large, monolithic files or classes.
- Use clear, explicit types and interfaces for all public APIs.
- Avoid `any`; use strict TypeScript typing throughout.
- Follow project linting and formatting rules at all times.
- Use named exports/imports; avoid default exports for clarity.
- Write tests for all new code and edge cases.
- Document all exported functions and modules.
- Use async/await for asynchronous code, never callbacks.
- Optimize for readability and maintainability over cleverness.
