# Commit Messages

## Explain with **detail** what all has changed

We love emojis 🚂🎛️🧶⏮️📦😂😎

We use emojis in commit messages to make them more expressive and engaging. Here’s how we use them:

x=major, y=minor, z=patch

## **examples**

```text
🚀 Use 👏 emojis, there are many to choose from, conventional commit message format. ex. {emoji, 1-3} {task}({scope}): {thoughtful commit message}
```

## Commit Message Guidelines

Use 1–3 emojis at the start of every commit message. Follow semantic-release format: {emoji(s)} {type}({scope}): {message}, using types like feat, fix, chore, or BREAKING CHANGE. Scope is optional, but the message must be clear, specific, and in present tense—never generic. Emojis are required for expressiveness and fast scanning. Semantic-release enables automated versioning and changelogs.
