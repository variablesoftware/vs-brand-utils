# Commit Messages

Explain with detail what all has changed.

We love emojis 🚂🎛️🧶⏮️📦😂😎

We use emojis in commit messages to make them more expressive and engaging. Here’s how we use them:

x=major, y=minor, z=patch

examples:

```
🚀 Use 👏 emojis, there are many to choose from, conventional commit message format. ex. <emoji, 1-3> <task>(<scope>): <thoughtful commit message>
```

```text
🌟 FEAT: We want a good release. x.Y.z ...
```

or

```text
🐛 FIX: We fixed a bug in the code. x.y.Z ...
```

or

```text
🧹 CHORE: We cleaned up the codebase. x.y.z ...
```

or

```text
🚨 BREAKING CHANGE: We made a change that breaks backward compatibility. X.y.z ...
```

## Commit Message Guidelines

We use semantic-release syntax for messaging.

- 😄 Emojis add clarity and fun to commit messages.
- 🏷️ They help visually categorize the type of change.
- 👀 Emojis make scanning commit history faster and more engaging.
- 🤝 They foster a positive, expressive team culture.
- ⚡️ Emojis can highlight breaking changes or important updates.
- 📚 They make our project history more memorable and welcoming.

- chore: (for changes that do not modify the public API, will not trigger a release)
- fix: (for bug fixes, triggers a patch release)
- feat: (for new features, triggers a minor release)
- BREAKING CHANGE: (in the body or footer, triggers a major release)
