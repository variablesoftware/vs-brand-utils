# Test Setup

We test using vitest, and typically the `--watch` flag is used to keep the test runner active for continuous feedback during development. Even if the VS Code Vitest extension is installed, we prefer to test using the command line to ensure consistency across environments.

```bash
yarn vitest --watch

```
